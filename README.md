# **Rewind**

<br>

Rewind has been developed as part of the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (Advanced Front End Portfolio Project #5).  The Django REST Framework has been used to build a backend API.  This returns JSON data to the front end which has been built using React.  The aim of the site is to provide a platform for a community of like minded music/technology enthusiasts who enjoy sharing snippets of nostalgia to evoke memories of the past and engaging in conversations about these snapshots in time.

### **Epics**

#### **EPIC: Navigation & User Authentication [#1](https://github.com/rkillickdev/rewind/issues/1)**

`
Users should be able to navigate the site effortlessly and access the site content in an intuitive manner. Certain features should only be accessible to authenticated users that have created a user profile.
`

#### **EPIC: Snapshot Lists [#8](https://github.com/rkillickdev/rewind/issues/8)**

`
Snapshots posted to the site should be available for all user to view, with authenticated users given additional control over the type of content they want to view.
`

#### **EPIC: Create Snapshots [#12](https://github.com/rkillickdev/rewind/issues/12)**

`
Logged in users should have the ability to post snapshots that will then be attached to their profile and available for other site users to enjoy.
`

#### **EPIC: Snapshot Details [#15](https://github.com/rkillickdev/rewind/issues/15)**

`
The detail page should display a specified snapshot post. All site users should have the ability to 'read' snapshots, logged in users should have the ability to comment on other user's snapshots and update/delete their own.
`

#### **EPIC: Like and Pin Snapshots [#21](https://github.com/rkillickdev/rewind/issues/21)**

`
As the user is viewing content on the site, they should have the ability to like snapshots and also pin any snapshot that catches their interest that they might want to return to later.
`

#### **EPIC: Profiles [#24](https://github.com/rkillickdev/rewind/issues/24)**

`
Logged in users should have the ability to update and tailor their own profile details. They should also be able to view the profiles of other site users and their associated snapshot posts. Users should be recommended other profiles to follow based on musical genre preferences specified in their own profiles

## **SKELETON PLANE**

## **Wireframes**

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) and used as a blueprint for development of the site layout and structure.
